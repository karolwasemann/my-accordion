### How to get started

Click the "Fork" button at the top of the editor to copy the exercise.

### Exercise purpose

Accordion is another very popular web component. Unfortunately, the one shown on the left, apart from its aesthetic qualities, does not have much to offer so far. It's time to change that.

Your tasks:

1. Implement the logic to wrap/expand sections after clicking on the arrow

2) automatically wrap the previous section if the user activates another

Bonus points:

1. add logic to change the state (toggle) of a section when double clicking on its title

2) Add section wrap animation
3) Add section expanding animation
